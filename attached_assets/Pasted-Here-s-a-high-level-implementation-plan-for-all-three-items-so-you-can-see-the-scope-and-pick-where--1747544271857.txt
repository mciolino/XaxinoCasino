Hereâ€™s a high-level implementation plan for all three itemsâ€”so you can see the scope and pick where to dive in first (or confirm youâ€™d like me to proceed in this sequence):

â¸»

1. ðŸ”§ Vue/React Frontend for Dice Module

a. Tech Stack & Architecture
	â€¢	Framework: React (with Hooks + Context) or Vue 3 (Composition API)
	â€¢	Real-Time Updates:
	â€¢	WebSockets (Laravel Echo + Pusher) or
	â€¢	Polling via Axios every few seconds
	â€¢	State Management:
	â€¢	React: Context + useReducer (or Redux)
	â€¢	Vue: reactive store (Pinia or Vuex)

b. Key Components
	â€¢	WalletBalance: displays BTC/ETH balance, auto-refresh
	â€¢	DiceForm: bet amount + client seed input
	â€¢	DiceResult: show roll, outcome, server seed hash/reveal
	â€¢	SeedVerifier: utility to recompute SHA256(server+client)

c. API Endpoints
	â€¢	GET /api/wallets/{currency} â†’ { balance }
	â€¢	POST /api/games/dice â†’ { rolled, payout, server_seed_hash, server_seed }

2. ðŸŽ° Prototype Slots / Blackjack Module

a. Folder Structure

/app/Games/Slots/
/app/Games/Blackjack/
  - SlotsController.php
  - BlackjackController.php
  - logic.php
/resources/views/games/slots/
/resources/views/games/blackjack/

b. Core Game Logic
	â€¢	Slots: random reels, paylines, payouts table
	â€¢	Blackjack: deck shuffling, hit/stand, dealer AI, hand value, payouts

c. Provably Fair Extension
	â€¢	Same seed-combination model as Dice
	â€¢	Publish server_seed_hash pre-game, reveal post-game

3. ðŸ“œ Smart-Contract ABI + Laravel Service for On-Chain Payouts

a. Solidity Contract & ABI
	â€¢	CasinoPayout.sol (payout function, owner-only)
	â€¢	Compile â†’ JSON ABI + bytecode

b. Laravel Service Class

class OnChainPayoutService {
    protected $web3;
    protected $contract;
    public function __construct() { â€¦ }
    public function payout(string $winner, float $amountEth) { â€¦ }
    public function getGasEstimate(...){ â€¦ }
}

c. Gas Management & Error Handling
	â€¢	Estimate gas â†’ add buffer
	â€¢	Retry logic on failure
	â€¢	Logging + notifications

Which would you like to tackle first?
	1.	Frontend for Dice
	2.	Prototype Slots/Blackjack
	3.	Smart-contract ABI & Laravel payout service

Or shall I simply jump in and start with #1: the Vue/React Dice frontend?
