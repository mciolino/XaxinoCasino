Here’s a comprehensive checklist of additional systems, services, and processes you’ll need beyond core deployment to build, implement, and operate a fully functional, scalable, and compliant online casino:

⸻

Summary

Beyond unzipping code, installing dependencies, and scaffolding game modules, you must integrate game variety and provably-fair randomness, establish a scalable, secure architecture, implement robust payment and user-management flows, satisfy regulatory and certification requirements, and provide engaging UX, analytics, and ongoing monitoring to ensure performance, fairness, and responsible operation.

⸻

##1. Core Game Functionality & Fair Play

Game Variety & Engine Integrations
	•	You’ll need a diverse portfolio: slots, table games, live dealer, virtual sports — each with its own rules engine or third-party integration  ￼.
	•	Ensure every game module is modular so it can be added/removed without impacting others  ￼.

Provably-Fair RNG & Certification
	•	Integrate a certified RNG (e.g., GLI-19) to generate outcomes and publish server_seed_hash before each round  ￼ ￼.
	•	Undergo GLI-19 testing to obtain formal compliance certificates for both software and hardware RNGs  ￼.
	•	Consider eCOGRA certification for “Safe & Fair” seals, covering RNG fairness, security controls, and responsible gambling practices  ￼.

⸻

##2. User Management & Responsible Gaming

Registration, 2FA & KYC
	•	Provide multi-channel registration (email, social logins) with mandatory 2FA (e.g., Google Authenticator)  ￼.
	•	Implement a KYC upload and review workflow, storing user documents and tracking statuses (pending/verified/rejected) for AML compliance  ￼.

Responsible Gambling Tools
	•	Offer self-exclusion, deposit limits, session reminders, and links to support organizations (eCOGRA standards)  ￼.
	•	Train staff on RG initiatives and integrate them into your platform’s UI and admin dashboards  ￼.

⸻

##3. Payments & Wallet Infrastructure

Crypto & Fiat Gateways
	•	Wire up Bitcoin/Ethereum wallets with on-chain deposit listening and withdraw via smart-contract payouts  ￼.
	•	Integrate Stripe and PayPal for fiat, handling PCI-DSS compliance and webhook callbacks  ￼.

Transaction Engine & Reconciliation
	•	Build a ledger system to record every bet, win, deposit, and withdrawal with atomic updates to user wallets.
	•	Schedule background jobs to reconcile on-chain transactions and detect anomalies.

⸻

##4. Scalable Technical Architecture

Modular Microservices & APIs
	•	Host game logic, user services, payment gateways, and admin back-office as separate services, communicating over REST or gRPC  ￼.
	•	Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for easy scaling, rolling updates, and isolation.

Performance & Load Balancing
	•	Deploy across multiple application servers behind a load balancer (NGINX, AWS ELB) to handle peak traffic spikes  ￼.
	•	Cache static assets via a CDN (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) and use in-memory stores (Redis) for session and rate-limit data.

⸻

##5. Security & Compliance

Infrastructure Security
	•	Enforce HTTPS/TLS, Web Application Firewalls, and DDoS protection (Cloudflare, AWS Shield).
	•	Conduct regular penetration tests and vulnerability scans (OWASP Top 10 compliance).

Regulatory Licensing
	•	Obtain jurisdictional licenses (e.g., UKGC, MGA, Curacao) and meet their reporting requirements  ￼.
	•	Maintain audit logs for all financial and game-outcome events for regulator inspections.

⸻

##6. Analytics, Monitoring & Maintenance

Reporting & Dashboards
	•	Build real-time dashboards for game KPIs, financial flows, user behavior, and compliance metrics  ￼.
	•	Integrate Google Analytics and server-side metrics (Prometheus, Grafana) for full-stack observability  ￼.

Continuous Deployment & Testing
	•	Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to automatically run unit, integration, and security tests on every commit.
	•	Automate database migrations, contract deployments, and smoke tests before rolling to production.

⸻

##7. Player Engagement & Support

UX/UI & Mobile Compatibility
	•	Implement responsive design and consider a Progressive Web App for mobile web play  ￼.
	•	Enhance immersion with high-quality graphics, sound effects, and animation optimized for low latency  ￼.

Loyalty, Promotions & Affiliation
	•	Develop a modular bonus engine for free spins, deposit matches, and tiered loyalty points.
	•	Build an affiliate system with tracking links, commission management, and payout scheduling.
