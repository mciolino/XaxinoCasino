🗺️ Next Steps
	1.	Choose your integration path:
	•	Aggregator (SoftSwiss, SoftGamings, EveryMatrix) for rapid, multi-provider deployment
	•	Direct per-provider for deeper control or exclusive titles
	2.	Obtain commercial licenses and developer accounts from each provider.
	3.	Configure API credentials and environment variables in your .env/Secrets panel.
	4.	Wire up your plugin loader (e.g., config/games.php) to enable each provider’s controller.
	5.	Test in sandbox mode and validate provably-fair mechanics before going live.

With these resources in hand, you’ll be equipped to import Starburst, Book of Dead, Mega Moolah, Gates of Olympus, White Rabbit Megaways, and many more into your modular Xaxino platform—ready for seamless deployment and central management.
